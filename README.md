# Developer Details

The template is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building web apps.

It can be easily deployed on Vercel, a powerful platform for hosting web apps.

It uses tailwind-css so you have a portfolio that is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes.

2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Edit the `portfolio.json` file to add your own information and projects.
